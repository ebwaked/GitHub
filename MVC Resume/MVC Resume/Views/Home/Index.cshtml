                    Driven by an insatiable internal force I, yearn to explore a wide variety of subject matters. Known somewhat as a renaissance man I pride myself in being great in any endever I set my mind to.
                    I am currently apart of the the first cohort of 2015 at Coder Foundry. The Coder Foundry has been a major part in my process to further my education; something which I believe is intergral to being
                    successful in my career. One of my hobbies is writing music. Playing guitar and piano allows me to express myself and relieve stress. I also enjoy the outdoors where camping and hiking are my
                    favorite activities. This stems from from my background in scouting. I was an active member in scouting from age 6 till age 18 and became an Eagle Scout in 2006.

                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>
                    I started college at UNC-Pembroke. I was a student athlete there for 2 years and I am very proud to have been apart of their innaugural football team. I decided to transfer to NC State where
                    I pursued a BS in Biology with a concentration in Plant Biology. After NC State I became a financial Service Representative for MetLife Premier Client Group in Greensboro. I was a junior parntner in the
                    agency but after spending 2 and a half years in the financial services industry I wanted to pursue what my real passion and hobby was; web developement.

                <h2>Why now?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are a few reasons why I left a potential career in financial services. I had a knack for understanding concepts and learning to implement good business habits into my practice, yet despite the
                    designations and licences obtained during my time in the industry I never felt truly happy. While I enjoyed it at the time and have no regrets taking that path early on, I believe it allowed me the vision
                    to pursue what I truly enjoy.

                <h2>How I will Benefit YOU</h2>
                <p>
                    The fast past enviroment at Coder Foundry pushes me to the limit of what I can do and sets the bar high with the amount of information learned in a short period of time. I learned how to
                    look at a problem, break it down into managable problems and implement those solutions with clean, clear and maintainable code. Over the course of this class we will learn a variety of
                    different things which includes: MVC, AngularJS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, C#, SQL, Web API, MicroORM's, and InsightDB.
